# Genetic-Algorithm-Demonstration

A demo of a genetic algorithm being used to train an AI agent to complete an obstacle course. In this scenario, the agent must learn to change its color depending on the color of the next obstacle, which is detected by its front sensor. If the agent's color matches that of the next obstacle, it is able to pass through.
